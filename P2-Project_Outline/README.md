### Overview
Application where home cooks, people who love cooking, share their recipes, ideas and cooking experiences. This can be an inspiration to others.

Many authentic recipes from many regions are not being made in recent times and are not heard by people outside their community. Through this application people around the world can know and taste the authentic recipes.

Our group chose this project because of how our grandmothers and great grandmothers were cooking and what will their recipes be like. If it was recorded it could have been useful for the present generation to follow their healthy living.
